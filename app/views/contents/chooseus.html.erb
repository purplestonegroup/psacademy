				<h3>Dynamic Activities</h3>
				<p>“As a teacher, I am constantly given challenges with every student that I come across. My overall teaching skills and skill set have improved because of the different needs, backgrounds, skill sets and demands that are unique to each individual student. Purple Stone Academy offers a great environment for advancing rapidly in the study of English, because it gives each student a tailored approach to learning English. You can expect to have a much higher rate of achievement simply because the class sizes are very small, averaging 4 to 6 students (maximum 12) which means the attention from the teacher will be much greater for each individual student!” (Lily, teacher)</p>
