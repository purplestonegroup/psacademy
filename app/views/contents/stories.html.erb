					<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Hi, I am Lisa. I attended Purple Stone Academy in the first month that I arrived in London. It is a really good school and the teachers are friendly and helpful with all the students. I learned a lot of things here. I highly recommend this school! I enjoy coming here because there are not many people so I improved a lot in a short time. One of the teachers corrected my CV and I am now in a better position to find a job <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

					<note>Lisa has studied English with Purple Stone Academy for four weeks. She could not speak English well, and she was keen to get a job quickly so that she can progress in her work.</note>

					<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Hi, my name is Fernando. I came to Purple Stone Academy to study English a few months ago, because I wanted to be able to find a job in Spain using my English. I was amazed at the level of dedication, support, encouragement and help that the teachers were offering there. It is a very small school and that is why I improved my English very quickly here! <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

					<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> I love studying here. I started studying here three months ago. When I started studying, my English was very bad. I liked the fact that I was given a learning programme so that I knew what to focus on. I used to find the accent of the English people very hard to understand but I am getting much better thanks to the dedication of my teacher at Purple Stone Academy! The thing I like most is that we learn and we also have a great time! <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

					<%= image_tag "fernando_spain.jpg", width: '180' %>

					<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> I think the course is very good and the teacher is amazing. There are also very few people per class and that is why you learn a lot more in an hour than at other places <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
